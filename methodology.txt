I decided to explore the universe of "Friends" the TV show. I downloaded all the scripts for all the shows from http://www.friendstranscripts.tk/, concatenated them in command line and decomposed the resulting file in Python. The goal was to see which friends interacted with each other more: if one person spoke after the other, there was an edge. The data, saved as html files, was definitely messy, and I had some issues with Gephi too, but the resulting image is at least evidence that the show is aptly named. I wasn't able to make nodes appear on the final graph so a screenshot is included, and controlling the nodes' positions seemed tricky, but it was a fun exercise, and a useful one, too.
